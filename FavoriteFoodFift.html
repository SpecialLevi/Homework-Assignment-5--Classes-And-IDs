                <!-- Number one to four states how to wash the grain before preparing -->
                <li class="preparation_step">
                    Measure 1 cup of Acha(fonio millet) into the first bowl, add water to surface level and cover 
                    for 3 to 5 minutes üçö
                </li>
                <li class="preparation_step">
                    Open and stair with hand.ü§ö
                </li>
                <li class="preparation_step">
                    immediately after staring, pour the staired acha(fonio millet) into the second bowl gradually while
                    shaking the bowl you are pouring from so as to allow the tiny stone particles settle below the
                    acha(fonio millet).
                </li>
                <li class="preparation_step">
                    Pour away the sand/stone particles and repeat the same process over and over again until you
                    can't see any stone particle. <strong>Note:</strong> The process to be repeated is the
                    stairing and pouring into the second bowl and not pouring water into the acha(fonio millet) and
                    covering for 3 to 5 minutes.
                </li>
                <!-- Number five to eight describes procedures from preparing to dishing -->
                <li class="preparation_step">
                    Add 3 cups of water to a cooking pot place on fire and allow it to boil.
                </li>
                <li class="preparation_step">
                    Pour the Acha(fonio millet) into the pot gradually while stirring with the wooden turner to prevent it from
                    sticking together. Once you notice that the Acha(fonio millet) is becoming thicker and not yet soft, add a 
                    cup of water and keep stirring.üçù
                </li>
